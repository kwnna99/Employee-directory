# Random Employee Directory
## Project Description
The following project is a random employee directory, created using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS (no libraries).
Upon being clicked, each user card triggers a popup with detailed information about the user.

## Data source
The employee/user data displayed are fetched via the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/).

## Project specifics
* The popup modal enables the user to a Carousel view of the employees by switching between them using the buttons.
* The search feature allows to search the user base by their first, last and a combination of first and last name (in the format of "First Last").
* The users list dynamically updates on keyup.
* For UX purposes, the modal can be closed either via the X icon on the top right or via clicking outside of the modal (on the overlay).
